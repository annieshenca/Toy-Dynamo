This is our team project a course in Fall 2018. We've developed it using Go and Docker. ~~It runs on a Jenkins server in Pete's apartment for CI testing.~~ Jenkins is terrible so we're going to implement CircleCI.

To execute, clone the repo and simply run `run.sh`. To run end-to-end testing, clone and run `test.sh`.
